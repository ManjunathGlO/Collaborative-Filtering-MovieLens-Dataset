## Collaborative-Filtering-MovieLens-Dataset
A machine learning project that implements a **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System** using the MovieLens dataset. The project analyzes user rating behavior to identify similar users and movies, enabling personalized movie recommendations based on historical preferences


## 📌 Business Problem

Streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ host thousands of movies, making it difficult for users to discover content they are likely to enjoy.

The goal of this project is to build a recommendation engine that leverages historical user ratings to:

- Recommend movies based on similar users.
- Identify movies with similar viewing patterns.
- Improve user engagement and retention through personalized recommendations.
- Reduce information overload by suggesting relevant content.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze MovieLens user rating data.
- Build a user–movie interaction matrix.
- Measure similarity between users and movies.
- Recommend movies using Collaborative Filtering.
- Explore user preferences and movie relationships.

---

## 🔄 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Loaded MovieLens datasets:
  - movies.csv
  - ratings.csv
  - links.csv
  - tags.csv

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Merged datasets where required.
- Created User–Movie Pivot Tables.
- Filled missing ratings with zero.

### 3. Similarity Computation
- Calculated User-to-User similarity using **Cosine Distance**.
- Calculated Movie-to-Movie similarity using **Correlation Distance**.

### 4. Recommendation Analysis
- Identified the top similar users.
- Found common movies watched by different users.
- Recommended similar movies based on correlation.

### 5. Result Interpretation
- Evaluated recommendation quality.
- Compared user preferences.
- Generated personalized recommendations.
